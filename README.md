# About

A pathetic attempt to implement util to play audio in terminal via `afplay`. The script can see `.flac` files only.

## Installation

To use the `sound` script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the script files:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sound.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd sound
   ```

3. Make the scripts executable:
   ```
   chmod +x sound.sh
   ```

## Usage

The `sound` script allows you to play audio files from a specified directory.

Specify directory of audio in `config.sh`.

To use the script, run:

```
./sound.sh
```

The script will prompt you to select an audio file to play.

Make sure to have the necessary audio files in the `MUSIC_DIR` directory to work correctly.
